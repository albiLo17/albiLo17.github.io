  I’m a Postdoctoral Researcher at Stanford University, working with Professor <a href="https://web.stanford.edu/~bohg/" target="_blank">Jeannette Bohg</a>. I obtained my PhD from the <a href="https://www.kth.se/en" target="_blank">KTH Royal Institute of Technology</a> under the supervision of <a href="https://www.csc.kth.se/~danik/" target="_blank">Professor Danica Kragic</a>. Before joining Stanford, I was a research intern at <a href="https://europe.naverlabs.com/" target="_blank">Naver Labs Europe</a>, where I worked with the Spatial AI team.
  <!-- , in the Division of <a href="https://www.kth.se/is/rpl/division-of-robotics-perception-and-learning-1.779439" target="_blank">Robotics, Perception and Learning (RPL)</a> -->


<!-- <p style="text-align: justify;"> -->
<!-- My research focuses on developing algorithms for intelligent agents capable of adaptive manipulation in human environments. I explore object-centric world models for inference, planning, and reasoning, alongside key areas such as object characterization, multimodal interactive perception, and learning of geometric and semantic representations. Recently, I have been curious about how to improve the physical and semantic reasoning of foundation models for deformable objects, with the aim of equipping agents to handle complex, variable tasks in real-world scenarios. -->
My research focuses on advancing Physical AI by integrating structured world models and multimodal perception to enable robots to perform complex tasks in unstructured, dynamic environments. I am particularly interested in leveraging the interplay between perception and modeling to learn representations of physical properties of real-world objects, embedding physics-based priors into learning systems, and exploring generative and hybrid approaches to improve the generalization and sample efficiency of current Physical AI. My vision is to develop intelligent robotic systems capable of long-horizon autonomy and robust assistive capabilities to support humans in real-world scenarios.

 <!-- I envision a future where robots are ubiquitous and capable of complex reasoning and manipulation tasks in unstructured, highly-variable environments. My research lies at the intersection of robotics and machine learning, focusing on the adaptive manipulation of Cloth-like Deformable Objects (CDO). This under-explored area requires novel approaches for the characterization, perception, modeling, and control of CDOs. I develop methods to characterize and perceive these objects, learning representations that account for their physical properties and advancing generalization techniques for learning-based dynamics and planning suitable for robotic manipulation. Additionally, I am currently exploring the use of foundation models to enhance the perception and manipulation of cloth-like objects, aiming to equip robots with enhanced adaptive skills. -->
